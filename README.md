Microblink is a company that provides a range of OCR and scanning services, including an SDK for Android that allows developers to integrate these services into their apps. Here is an example of how to use the Microblink SDK in an Android app to perform OCR:

    Add the Microblink library to your app's build.gradle file:
```
implementation 'com.microblink:blinkid:4.16.0'
```
    Add the Microblink API key to your app's AndroidManifest.xml file:
```
<meta-data
    android:name="com.microblink.api.key"
    android:value="YOUR_API_KEY" />
```
    Create a configuration object for the OCR activity:
```
OcrConfiguration ocrConfiguration = new OcrConfiguration.Builder(this)
        .setOcrLanguages(OcrLanguage.ENGLISH)
        .build();
```
    Start the OCR activity:
```
OcrScanActivity.startOcrScanActivityForResult(this, REQUEST_CODE, ocrConfiguration);
```
    Handle the result in the onActivityResult method:
```
@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);

    if (requestCode == REQUEST_CODE && resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
        // Get the OCR result
        String ocrResult = data.getStringExtra(OcrScanActivity.EXTRAS_OCR_RESULT);
    }
}
```
That's it! You can now use the OCR result in your app.
